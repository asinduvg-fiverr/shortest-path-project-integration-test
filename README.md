# Win23--SFT221-NBB-1-
The repository for the SFT project for group 1
the incomeplete code can be version 2 and the testing project can be version 1. The "beta" test. 

<<<<<<< Testing-project-incomplete-v2
I updated the code. in testing project incomplete v2.  Which is a branch.
What was done: 
-updated so packages are now storad on trucks with capacity, weight and size. Packages are stored based on shortest distance. 
I have lines to print where packages are stored in the trucks right now for trouble shooting. 
-imeplemented storage so that when trucks are full the packages are sent to storage. 
Needs to do:
-The diversion is incorrect at the moment in this version 
-the mapping is still not printed 

<<<<<<< Merger
Merged the relevant code from Testing-project-incomplete-v2 wtih incomplete-v1
The diversion added and added to the route in processShipment()
